There are total 4 types texts in whole system.

1. h1 main title
2. h2 sub title
3. h3 third title
4. text-base (span, div, p)
   Make sure that whenever you add some text it should be in on for four. Also make sure that for h1,h2,h3 you never add tailwind classes for font-size

Always use the tailwind base classes for size/spacing which is equivanlent px value in figma. If there is no tailwind base class then use rem but don't use px into the styles.
Copy the exact styles from figma.
Download the images from figma which is missing and store that in public/images and then use it. Rename the images to meaningful names. Also keep a proper structure in public/images
Store the icons in app/helpers/icons.tsx in the same way I have same one there.
