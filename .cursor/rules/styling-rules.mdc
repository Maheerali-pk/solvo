Always use the tailwind base classes for size/spacing which is equivanlent px value in figma. If there is no tailwind base class then use rem but don't use px into the styles.
Store the colors in @global.css as css/tailwind variables and then use those on the frontend
Divide everything in components don't just put so many sections in one page.
Copy the exact styles from figma.
Don't the images from figma which is missing and store that in public/images and then use it. Rename the images to meaningful names. Also keep a proper structure in public/images
Store the icons in app/helpers/icons.tsx in the same way I have same one there.
